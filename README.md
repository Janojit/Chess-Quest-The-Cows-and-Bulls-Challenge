# Chess Quest: The Cows and Bulls Challenge

## Introduction

**Chess Quest: The Cows and Bulls Challenge** is an innovative two-player game that seamlessly blends the strategic depth of Chess with the engaging mechanics of the classic number-guessing game **Cows and Bulls**. This hybrid game offers a unique experience where the outcome of the Cows and Bulls challenge determines which player gains the advantage of playing as White in the subsequent Chess match.

Developed using **Python** and presented through a **Jupyter Notebook**, this project showcases the integration of game logic and interactive gameplay within a versatile programming environment.

## Features

- **Cows and Bulls Game**: Engage in a fun number-guessing game to determine the advantage in Chess.
- **Chess Gameplay**: Experience classic Chess with all standard rules and mechanics.
- **Interactive Interface**: Utilize Jupyter Notebook's interactive capabilities for an enhanced gaming experience.
- **Visual Assets**: Incorporate images and icons to enrich the visual presentation of the game.

## How It Works

1. **Cows and Bulls Challenge**:
   - Players take turns guessing a 4-digit number.
   - After each guess, feedback is provided in the form of "Cows" (correct digit in the wrong position) and "Bulls" (correct digit in the correct position).
   - The player who successfully guesses the number in fewer attempts earns the privilege to play as White in Chess.

2. **Chess Game**:
   - Following the Cows and Bulls challenge, players engage in a standard game of Chess.
   - The player with the White pieces moves first, leveraging the initial advantage.
   - The game proceeds until a checkmate is achieved, declaring the winner.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook for running the interactive game environment.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Janojit/Chess-Quest-The-Cows-and-Bulls-Challenge.git
    cd Chess-Quest-The-Cows-and-Bulls-Challenge
    ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    Install the necessary packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Launch the Game**:

    Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    In the opened browser window, navigate to and open the `21112011_21112033_CAC_1_Game.ipynb` notebook to start the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Cows and Bulls Challenge**:
   - Upon launching the notebook, follow the on-screen instructions to begin the number-guessing game.
   - Enter your 4-digit guesses when prompted.
   - Receive feedback in the form of "Cows" and "Bulls" after each guess.
   - Determine the winner based on who guesses the number with fewer attempts.

2. **Transition to Chess**:
   - The winner of the Cows and Bulls challenge will play as White in the Chess game.
   - Use the notebook interface to make Chess moves following standard Chess rules.
   - The game continues until a checkmate is declared.
