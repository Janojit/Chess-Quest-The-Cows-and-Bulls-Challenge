### Chess Quest: The Cows and Bulls Challenge

The code you provided is a Python program that implements a two-player chess game. It allows two players to play chess against each other on an 8x8 chessboard. The game includes features like selecting and moving pieces, capturing opponent pieces, and checking for a checkmate condition. It also displays a game over message when one player wins the game.

The program also includes a portion at the beginning that seems to be related to a "Cows and Bulls" game, which is a guessing game. In this game, two players take turns guessing a 4-digit number, and the player who guesses the number in fewer tries wins. The player who wins this guessing game gets to play as White in the chess game.

To make a report of this game, you can describe the following key aspects of the code:

1. Game Rules:
   - Explain that the code allows two players to play chess against each other.
   - Describe the rules of chess, including how pieces move, capturing, and checkmate conditions.
   - Mention the capturing of opponent pieces and how it affects the game.

2. Chessboard:
   - Describe the layout of the chessboard, including the 8x8 grid.
   - Explain how the pieces are initially arranged on the board (starting positions).

3. Player Interaction:
   - Explain how players select and move their pieces by clicking on the chessboard.
   - Mention that valid moves are displayed on the screen.

4. End of Game:
   - Describe the conditions for ending the chess game.
   - Explain how the program determines the winner and displays a game over message.

5. Cows and Bulls Game:
   - Mention the part of the code that involves a "Cows and Bulls" game.
   - Explain the rules of this guessing game, where players guess a 4-digit number without repeating digits.

6. Player Assignment:
   - Mention that the winner of the "Cows and Bulls" game gets to play as White in the chess game.

7. Execution:
   - Explain that the program runs in a loop until the chess game is over, and players can restart the game by pressing ENTER after a game over.

The code uses the Pygame library for graphics and user interface in the chess game..
